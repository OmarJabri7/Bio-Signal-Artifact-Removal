# EEG-Artifact-Removal---UofG-Thesis
In this repository, I will support the work of a PhD student in removing noise in EEG signals by using an AI algorithm for real-time noise reduction. &lt;br> This Algorithm is used on generated EEG signals (Synthetic/Fake) in which the contents are known, allowing for a better algorithm benchmark.
