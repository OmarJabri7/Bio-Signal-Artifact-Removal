EEG during everyday tasks
=========================

This database contains single channel EEG recordings
while performing a range of everyday tasks. The EEG 
was recorded between Fp1 and mastoid/ear. In addition 
EMG was recorded between the chin and mastoid/ear
Most of the subjects were also filmed during these tasks.
In total there were 27 subjects and 20 with video footage.

The tasks were:
- relaxed (lying down) as a control condition,
- blinking while lying down
- eyes crunching while lying down
- raising eyebrows while lying down
- jaw bite while lying down
- reading while lying down
- reading while sitting
- playing the game "flow" while sitting
- solving a "sudoku" while sitting
- solving a "wordsearch" task while sitting
- playing "templerun" while sitting

20 sessions have been videoed in full HD so that it is possible
to see which action or facial expression has caused
which artefact. These 20 sessions have been synced up between
video and data.


Data format
===========
The data format for all recordings is:

timestamp Fp1 CHIN switch

The sampling rate is 1kHz and was recorded with
a USB-DUX-D connected to a head worn pre-amplifier 
running at a gain of 500.


Artefact labelling
==================
The artefacts were labelled by identifying facial expressions, movements
and other visible behaviours which then showed up in the EEG data.


Example code
============
Examples are provided how to read the data in both Python/MATLAB.
The Python code also provides an API which provides the data
directly as numpy arrays.
